This one serve as a demo of how to use TCP to build a file storage server that can store and retrieve files
The whole project is to learn from simple to complex, so here I'm not directly using HTTP protocol but a customized protocol
to show why do we need protocol like FTP or HTTP

What we support here:
Version 1:
Get file from server: the request should be in following format:
    GET "[FILENAME]"
Response:
    [STATUS_CODE] [FILE_CONTENT]
    status code:
        0: file found
        1: file not found

Store file to server: the request should be in following format:
    STORE "[FILENAME]" [FILE_CONTENT]

DELETE file from server: the request should be in following format:
    DELETE "[FILENAME]"


We add a "" to make sure the filename is correctly parsed, otherwise we won't have file name with space in it
